      <p>Here are the 3 Best restaurants. Two San Diego restaurants — Addison in Carmel Valley and Market in Del Mar– made OpenTable‘s new list of the 100 top restaurants for foodies in the United States.

        The restaurant reservation service on   Wednesday released the 100 Best   Restaurants for Foodies in America for  2016. California has 17 winning   restaurants, followed by New York with  nine and Pennsylvania with eight.

        Other top foodie restaurants near San Diego are Le Vallauris in Palm Springs and Marché Moderne in Costa Mesa

        “These standout restaurants are delicious destinations for the most passionate eaters — those for whom dining out is practically sport,” said Caroline Potter, OpenTable’s chief dining officer.

        “Using ingredients both humble and exotic and drawing culinary inspiration from around the globe, this year’s honorees consistently offer thrilling experiences sure to please even the most discerning diners,” she said.

        The list is based on more than 5 million restaurant reviews submitted by OpenTable diners between Aug. 1, 2015, and July 31, 2016.</p>
